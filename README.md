# ecosystem-engineers-analysis
This repository includes the files used to generate the results found in the Arroyo-Esquivel and Hastings paper. The repository files are described as follows:

- **root_finder.m**: Identifies the equilibria of the system for any value of the parameters and calculates the eigenvalues of their linearized system.
- **critical_mu_finder.m**: For given values of the parameters, identifies the value of the dispersal rate which produces a saddle node bifurcation.
- **attractor_finder.m**: For given values of the parameters, identifies the minimum population required at one patch in order to ensure spread of the population into the second patch.
